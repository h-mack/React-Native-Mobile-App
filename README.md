# React-Native-Mobile-App
N.b. The API used for share information for this project was from a QUT database and required the use of a QUT VPN to access the data.
Such access will be required for the application to function correctly.
## Description
Designed and developed a react native mobile application in react native and an accompanying web application in react.
The application allows users to browse and track share market information through querying an API and presenting the share information in an interactive manner through two interface screens with a bottom tab navigation.
One tab is a list of all the available shares and some brief information.
If a share is selected, it will expand to show further information on that share.
Shares can be favourited and will appear in the second interface screen as a "favourites list".
The favourites list saves state and will remember which shares were favourited upon shutting down the app and reloading it.
Android Stuido was used to test the build and implementation of this project.
